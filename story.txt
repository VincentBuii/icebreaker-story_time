KLIMAANLAGE! That's what my mom used to say everytime I showed her my report card. "BMW biergarten audi schloss," she told me in front of all my friends waiving around my 4.0 GPA. I turn to them with a smug look,"she said 'I have never been prouder"."  "Vee must celebrate!  Tonight vee vill habt ein Bratwurst for dinner" she cried in her heavy German accent she got whenever too excited. That night we went to the fanciest restaurant in town, The Ratskeller Dirndel Lederhose, where my mom ordered her most favorite German meal, the wet- tbewerbsfaehig; and what do you know, I turn to my right and see Dr. Mehlhase eating it too!  The aptly named  "wettbewerbsfaehig" is an enourmous meal, generally consumed by people at festivals in eating competitions due to, in Grossvater's words: "that plate is the size of Flughafen Berlin!"
