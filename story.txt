KLIMAANLAGE! That's what my mom used to say everytime I showed her my report card. "BMW biergarten audi schloss," she told me in front of all my friends waiving around my 4.0 GPA. I turn to them with a smug look,"she said 'I have never been prouder"."  "Vee must celebrate!  Tonight vee vill habt ein Bratwurst for dinner" she cried in her heavy German accent she got whenever too excited.
