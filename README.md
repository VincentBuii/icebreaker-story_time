# Icebreaker: Story Time
This repository is for the SER316 story time Icebreaker assignment.

## Story time
This is supposed to be a little fun "get to know each other" exercise. Do not take it too seriously but you will be graded on doing it. It is more about fun and working a bit on Git as a team without having to be worried to mess the project repo up.

Create a public repository on GitHub with any reasonable name and add all your team members to this repository. Also add ser316asu as collaborators.

Below you find a couple of German words (I know I am mean, you will probably have to look them up).

Step 1) Create a dictonary.txt file which will hold the German word and its translation in English if there is a translation for it.

Step 2) Your task is to create a (funny) story with the given German words. This story is supposed to use at least 10 of the German words. Your story can of course be in English and incorporate the words in any way you want to. This is supposed to be fun and lightweight, it is not about having a perfect story and has nothing really to do with SE just that you use Git and hopefully have some fun with your team members.

To do so you work on your story.txt file (put it in you repo). Each of you add one sentence at a time to the story which you can do directly on master or create branches for it to practice working with branches â€“ might be a good idea (you can work asynchronously on this), if you get a conflict resolve it so the story still makes some sense or not ;-)).

Each sentence should use one of the 10 words (or more). So overall you will end up with roughly 10 sentences and each of you should write 2 of them (your 2 sentences should not follow one another). So you need to check in on this at least twice!

Each new sentence must be appended to the end of the story. It is not allowed to add new sentences anywhere else in the story (otherwise it would not be as difficult and fun). 

When you are done then post your story AND your GitHub link to our #story channel with your group name as the first line, so we know who it is for.

Step 3) Individually, each of you should go to at least one other GitHub repo from another team (see links on #story channel) and clone that repo, create a new branch (name should be your asurite), add a sentence to the story, and create a PullRequest for their repo to add your new sentence to their story!

Step 4) The team should review all incoming PullRequests and either approve or decline with a reasoning.

Step 5) Vote for your favorite Story with thumbsup on Slack #story.
